# Contributing to MCP Web Tools

Thanks for considering a contribution. Bug reports, feature requests, and PRs are welcome.

For the project overview and architecture, see [README.md](README.md) and the [docs site](https://datvietvac-techhub.github.io/mcp-web-tools/).

## Local dev loop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datvietvac-techhub/mcp-web-tools.git
cd mcp-web-tools
./install.sh                         # one-time bootstrap
make up                              # start the stack
make playground                      # iterate against POST /search, POST /extract

# after editing mcp/*.py:
make build && make restart           # rebuild the web-mcp image and restart
make logs                            # tail all services
python -m compileall mcp
pytest
```

For pure tool-impl changes you can also run `mcp/playground.py` directly against the running stack — it imports the same `web_search_impl` / `web_extractor_impl`, so behavior matches the MCP server exactly.

## Coding conventions

- **Python**: target the version pinned in [`mcp/Dockerfile`](mcp/Dockerfile). Keep tool impls (`mcp/tools.py`) free of MCP- or FastAPI-specific imports so both `server.py` and `playground.py` can share them.
- **Tool contracts are stable** — return shapes for `web_search` / `web_extractor` are part of the public surface; bump [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md) when you change them.
- **Failures are values, not exceptions** — both tools return a dict with an `error` field on failure (and `results: []` / `status: "error"` per URL). Don't raise from tool entrypoints.
- **Caching keys** must include every input that affects the response (query, categories, language, time_range, mode, query for bm25/llm, etc.).
- **URL policy** starts in `mcp/url_policy.py`. Keep the default extractor zero-config unless a future hardening change explicitly introduces optional allow/deny controls.
- **Shell scripts** are bash-only, `set -euo pipefail`, and must stay idempotent. Test both in-repo and curl-pipe paths when touching `install.sh`.
- **Compose**: don't add new host-port bindings without an env-var default and a note in `.env.example` + the config table at [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md).

## Submitting changes

1. Fork and create a feature branch off `main`.
2. Run `python -m compileall mcp`, `pytest`, and `make build && make restart && make smoke` before pushing — all three endpoints must return `ok` / `2xx`.
3. If your change touches a tool's request/response shape, update [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md) and any clients you know of.
4. Open a PR with:
   - what changed and why (one paragraph is fine),
   - `make smoke` output, or a manual `curl` against the relevant endpoint,
   - any new env vars added to `.env.example`,
   - a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `## [Unreleased]` (Keep a Changelog format).
5. Avoid drive-by reformatting; keep diffs focused.

## Reporting issues

When filing a bug, include:

- output of `docker compose ps` and `docker compose version`,
- relevant logs: `make logs` (or `docker compose logs <service>`),
- `.env` with `SEARXNG_SECRET` and `CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN` redacted,
- exact tool call (params) and the response you got.

Use the [bug report issue template](https://github.com/datvietvac-techhub/mcp-web-tools/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) for a pre-filled checklist.
