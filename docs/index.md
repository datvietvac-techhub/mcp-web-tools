# MCP Web Tools

> Self-hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server giving AI agents free `web_search` and `web_extractor` tools — search via SearXNG, extract via Crawl4AI, no paid API keys.

> Previously known as **Agent Web Tool MCP** / [`agent-web-tool-mcp`](https://github.com/datvietvac-techhub/agent-web-tool-mcp). GitHub redirects old URLs — existing clones and links keep working.

**MCP Web Tools is a self-hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets developers serve `web_search` and `web_extractor` to their AI agents locally — instead of paying per-query for [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/), [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), or [Serper](https://serper.dev/).** Search is backed by a self-hosted [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) metasearch instance aggregating ~70 engines; extraction is backed by [Crawl4AI](https://docs.crawl4ai.com/), which fetches pages with a headless Chromium and returns clean Markdown.

The whole stack is a 4-service Docker Compose deployment: [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server + SearXNG + Crawl4AI + [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) cache. Apache-2.0 licensed.

## Why self-host MCP Web Tools?

- **Free per-query**: replace Brave Search API / Tavily API / Serper / Bing keys (each paid per query) with a stack you control.
- **Private by default**: agent queries never leave your network — only the underlying SearXNG / Crawl4AI fetches do.
- **One `docker compose up`**: runs on a dev laptop, a shared internal box, or a VM. No SaaS account, no rotating API keys.
- **Reproducible**: pin every upstream image for byte-identical redeploys.
- **Standard MCP surface**: works unchanged with Claude Code, Cursor, Hermes, or any MCP-compatible client.

## Use cases

- Agent web access without paying per-query for SaaS search APIs.
- Markdown extraction from arbitrary URLs (for RAG ingestion, summarization, agentic browsing, web scraping).
- A self-hostable, auditable web-tool layer that does not leak agent prompts to a third-party SaaS.
- A single `docker compose up` to add web capability to Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client.
